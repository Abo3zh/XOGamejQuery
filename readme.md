XO Game (Tic Tac Toe)
=====================
Tic Tac Toe (XO) is a single player game against PC, using AI algorithms like Best First Search (BFS) and Minimax. It has been developed under javascript as JQuery extension


Best First Search
-----------------
Best-first search is a search algorithm which explores a graph by expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule.

Judea Pearl described best-first search as estimating the promise of node n by a "heuristic evaluation function f(n) which, in general, may depend on the description of n, the description of the goal, the information gathered by the search up to that point, and most important, on any extra knowledge about the problem domain. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search


MiniMax (MinMax)
----------------
Minimax (sometimes minmax) is a decision rule used in decision theory, game theory, statistics and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss while maximizing the potential gain. Alternatively, it can be thought of as maximizing the minimum gain (maximin). Originally formulated for two-player zero-sum game theory, covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves, it has also been extended to more complex games and to general decision making in the presence of uncertainty. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax
